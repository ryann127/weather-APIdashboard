# weather-APIdashboard

This is a project using JavaScript and server-side APIs, such as OpenWeather Map

I made a weather dashboard that displays the current day's weather for a chosen city and that city's 5-day forecast. 

Local storage is also used to update the list of previously searched cities to then be clicked and taken to their weather.

A homework assignment given from Bootcamp to learn about server-side APIs

## Functionality of Website and Points of Interest

When a city is searched, you are presented wtih current and future conditions for the city. The city is added to the search history.

Current conditions can be seen for the city, such as the weather condition (and its corresponding icon), temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index -- the latter of which updates in color depending on severity. All this is displayed alongside the city name and date.

A 5-day forecast is also rendered, which displays the corresponding date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
